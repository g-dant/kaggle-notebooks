# My Kaggle Notebooks

## What is Kaggle

Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle allows users to collaborate with other users, find and publish datasets, use GPU integrated notebooks, and compete with other data scientists to solve data science challenges. The aim of this online platform (founded in 2010 by Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard and acquired by Google in 2017)  is to help professionals and learners reach their goals in their data science journey with the powerful tools and resources it provides.
